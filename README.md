This is a simple diary created by me as to guide me on learning ionic. 

Created a simple ionic form with ngModel and using firebase as my database.

Functionalities:

1. View diary inserted at home page
2. Add a new diary 
3. Slide button for edit and delete
4. On press of delete button a pop up will appear and on tapping delete, the specific diary will be removed
5. Added icon and splash screen(need some tweaks on this).


To run the file on android.

1. Clone the repo
2. add your own firebase config file.
3. run npm install firebase --save with root priviledges.
4. run in terminal ionic cordova platform add android
5. run in terminal ionic cordova run android --device.
6. Make sure development mode is enabled in your device bundled with allow install from USB
